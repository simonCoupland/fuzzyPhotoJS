Fuzzy Photo JS Readme
----------------------------------

Version 1.0

The second version of the FuzzyPhoto has been rewritten in may places.
The API makes use of JSON Padding to overcome cross-comain issues.
Rather that inspecting XML file we are now inspecting JSON (P) files which contain the callback function FPCallback.
The directories contain the all the code needed for each institution.
We now provide each institution with a bespoke implementation, these could be brought together if desired.
